"Read Me Please, so you understand how I can, the digital-clock application can enrich your life!"

This is application is a digital clock that correlates with the worldwide internet time. This also means it is aware of the time zone the user is in as well so no 
need to worry about changing it.
It is a AM/PM clock that also notates the time down to the second. 
Essentially this project was just a way to test my technical prowess in java script.
